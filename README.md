# Setup Mac
This project is used to setup my mac and keep it in sync with my work computer. 
It is inspired and heavily influenced by Jeff Geerling's amazing https://github.com/geerlingguy/mac-dev-playbook project, but I am starting over as my needs have diverged
 too much from Jeffs script, as well as wanting to work on 
my knowledge of ansible. I recently read a great article on "do nothing" scripts and thought it was a great approach for automation
